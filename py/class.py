"""To illustrate these ideas, this section will now explore the code
for the definition of a Counter class. A counter object, as the name
implies, tracks an integer count. A counterâ€™s value is initially 0 and
can be reset to 0 at any time. You can increment or decrement a
counter, obtain its current integer value, obtain its string
representation, or compare two counters for equality"""
