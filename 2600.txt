The first time that Jean-Claude Pelletier read Benno von Archimboldi
was Christmas 1980, in Paris, when he was nineteen years old and
studying German literature.

The book in question was D'Arsonval.

The young Pelletier didn't realize at the time that the novel was part
of a trilogy (made up of the English-themed The Garden and the
Polish-themed The Leather Mask, together with the clearly
French-themed D'Arsonval), but this ignorance or lapse or
bibliographical lacuna, attributable only to his extreme youth, did
nothing to diminish the wonder and admiration that the novel stirred
in him.                           

From that day on (or from the early morning hours when he concluded
his maiden reading) he became an enthusiastic Archimboldian and set
out on a quest to find more works by the author. This was no easy
task.

Getting hold of books by Benno von Archimboldi in the 1980s, even in
Paris, was an effort not lacking in all kinds of difficulties. Almost
no reference to Archimboldi could be found in the university's German
department. 

Pelletier's professors had never heard of him.

One said he thought he recognized the name. 

Ten minutes later, to Pelletier's outrage (and horror), he realized
that the person his professor had in mind was the Italian painter,
regarding whom he seeon revealed himself to be equally ignorant.

Pelletier wrote to the Hamburg publishing house that had published
D'Arsonval and received no response.

He also scoured the few German bookstores he could find in Paris. The
name Archimboldi appeared in a dictionary of German literature and in
a Belgian magazine devoted-whether as a joke or seriously, he never
knew- to the literature of Prussia.

In 1981 he made a trip to Bavaria with three friends from the German
department, and there, in a little bookstore in Munich, on
Voralmstrasse, he found two other books: the slim volume titled
Mitzy's Treasure, less than one hundred pages long, and the
aforementioned English novel, The Garden.

Reading these two novels only reinforced the opinion he'd already
formed of Archimboldi.

In 1983, at the age of twenty-two, he undertook the task of
translating D'Arsonval. No one asked him to do it.

At the time, no French publishing house was interested in publishing
the German author with a funny name.

Essentially Pelletier set out to translate the book because he liked
it, and because he enjoyed the work, although it also occurred to him
that he could submit the translation prefaced with a study of the
Archimboldian oeuvre, as his thesis, and why not?- as the foundation
of his future dissertation.

He completed the final draft of the translation in 1984, and a Paris
publishing house, after some inconclusive and contradictory readings,
accepted it and published Archimboldi. Though the novel seemed
destined from the start not tel sell more than a thousand copies, the
first printing of three thousand was exhausted after a couple of
contradictory, positive, even effusive reviews, opening the door for
second, third, and fourth printings.

By then Pelletier had read fifteen books by the German writer,
translated two others, and was regarded almost universally as the
preeminent authority on Benno von Archimboldi across the length and
breadth of France.

Then Pelletier could think back on the day when he first read
Archimboldi, and he saw himself, young and poor, living in a chambre
de bonne, sharing the sink where he washed his face and brushed his 
teeth with fifteen other people who lived in the same dark garret,
shitting in a horrible and notably unhygienic bathroom that was more
like a latrine or cesspit, also shared with fifteen residents of the
garret, some of whom had already returned to the provinces, their
respective university degrees in hand, or had moved to slightly more
comfortable places in Paris itself, or were still there- just a few of
them- vegetating or slowly dying of revulsion.

He saw himself, as we've said, ascetic and hunched over his German
